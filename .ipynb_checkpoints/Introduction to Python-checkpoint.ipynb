It can be used to create many things including web applications, desktop applications, as scripting interpreter and most relevant for you -- as a data analysis tool.. whether it is about '*making sense*' of the dataset that you are working with, scraping and cleaning the publicly available datasets or simply automating a task.. you will find python to be very agile to fit your needs. \n",
